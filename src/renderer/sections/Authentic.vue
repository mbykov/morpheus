    <h2>attention to authentic grammar:</h2>

    <p>Morpheus is <b>not</b> a linguistic program. It is intended to help in reading and understanding the text, and not to study the boring theoretical construction of "language." The ancient and foreign cultural authors did not know the concept of "language". Did not know about nouns and adjectives. Their grammar is similar to what is now taught in theatrical high schools as the art of speech. And subject and predicate - is not the same as the topic and commentary, absolutely not. Therefore, the Morpheus development takes into account first of all not the modern linguistic theory, but the grammar used by the author of the text, authentic grammar.</p>
